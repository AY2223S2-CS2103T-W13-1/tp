Introducing **MediConnect** - the hospital management application designed to  **streamline patient management,
doctor coordination, and hospital billing.** As a centralised platform, **MediConnect** offers healthcare
professionals and administrative staff an efficient solution to manage administrative matters in local clinics.
The app simplifies the organization and maintenance of patient and doctor data, appointments and billing records. <br>
**MediConnect** can be used with either a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).
Users experienced with the CLI may get their tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. <br>

_With MediConnect, managing your healthcare practice has never been easier._

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
   * If you are unsure of your system's Java version, you may use [this guide](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html) to find out.

2. Download the latest `MediConnect.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your MediConnect.

4. Double-click the file to start the app.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

    </p>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all stored patients and doctors.

   * `addPatient n/Ben Smith p/98353535 e/ben@abc.com ic/S1234567A a/Ben Street, block 13, #01-01` : Adds a patient named `Ben Smith` to MediConnect.

   * `delete ic/S1234567A` : Deletes the person with NRIC `S1234567A` from the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all persons stored in the application.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but it's specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be stored.

* Parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
    * **All other items must be filled, following the restrictions in the table below.**

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
